## 🎬 How to Use

### Step 1: Open Zync in DaVinci Resolve
1. Create or open a DaVinci Resolve project
2. Import your camera clips and master audio file into the Media Pool
3. Go to **Workspace → Workflow Integrations → Zync**

### Step 2: Select Your Media
- **Master Audio:** Click **Browse** and select your primary audio track (must be 40+ seconds)
- **Camera Clips:** Check the boxes next to the camera clips you want to sync
- **Output Timeline:** Give your synced timeline a name (e.g., "SYNC_MULTICAM")

### Step 3: Click Sync
- Zync analyzes the audio waveforms and automatically aligns all clips to your master
- Progress appears in the log window
- Once complete, a new timeline is created with all clips synced

### Step 4: Review & Edit
- New timeline appears in your project automatically
- All clips are positioned frame-accurately to match the master audio
- Make any fine adjustments in the timeline if needed

**That's it.** Your multicam timeline is ready to edit.

## 💡 Tips

- **Master audio should be at least 40 seconds long** for reliable sync
- **All clips must overlap with the master audio** (even partially)
- **Handles long recordings:** Works with hours of footage, including drift correction
- **Multiple masters:** Run Zync multiple times with different master files if needed

## ⚙️ Enable External Scripting (One-Time Setup)

1. Open DaVinci Resolve → **Preferences**
2. Go to **General** tab
3. Set **External scripting using** to **Local**
4. Restart DaVinci Resolve

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Extension doesn't appear in menu | Restart DaVinci Resolve completely |
| "Cannot connect to DaVinci" | Verify External Scripting is set to **Local** in Preferences |
| Master audio won't sync | Ensure master audio is 40+ seconds long and overlaps with camera clips |
| Installer fails | Run: `sudo installer -pkg Zync-DaVinci-Installer.pkg -target /` |
